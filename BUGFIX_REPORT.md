# Bug Fix Report: Cultivation Mechanics

## Issue Description
There was a mismatch between what was displayed in the UI and what was actually being implemented in the code. When upgrading cultivation mechanics, the actual effect applied was significantly lower than what was described in the UI:

1. The Qi Circulation upgrade showed "+9 Qi/second" but only added 0.1 to the rate
2. The Spirit Sense upgrade showed "+10 Qi per click" but only added 2 per click
3. The cultivation techniques had similar issues with their effects

## Root Cause
The issue was in the `gameEngine.ts` file where the upgrade effects were being applied. The implementation was not matching the descriptions and values defined in `constants.ts`.

### Original Code (with bugs):
```typescript
// In gameEngine.ts, circulation upgrade:
case 'circulation':
  // Increase passive Qi generation by 0.1 per level
  newGameState.energyRate += 0.1;
  break;
  
// Spirit sense upgrade:
case 'spirit':
  // Increase manual cultivation by 2 per level
  newGameState.manualCultivationAmount += 2;
  break;
  
// Skill effects:
// Increase Qi rate
const effectAmount = skillId === 'basic-qi' ? 0.1 : 0.3;
newGameState.energyRate += effectAmount;
newGameState.skills[skillId].effect += effectAmount;

// Mystic ice technique:
case 'mystic-ice':
  // Effect is calculated when attempting breakthrough
  newGameState.skills[skillId].effect += 0.05;
  break;
```

### Fixed Code:
```typescript
// In gameEngine.ts, circulation upgrade:
case 'circulation':
  // Increase passive Qi generation by 9 per level
  newGameState.energyRate += 9;
  break;
  
// Spirit sense upgrade:
case 'spirit':
  // Increase manual cultivation by 10 per level
  newGameState.manualCultivationAmount += 10;
  break;
  
// Skill effects:
// Increase Qi rate (25 for basic-qi, 40 for fireheart)
const effectAmount = skillId === 'basic-qi' ? 25 : 40;
newGameState.energyRate += effectAmount;
newGameState.skills[skillId].effect += effectAmount;

// Mystic ice technique:
case 'mystic-ice':
  // Increase breakthrough chance by 9% per level
  newGameState.skills[skillId].effect += 0.09;
  break;
```

## Verification
The changes will be applied to the built JavaScript files when deploying to Netlify. The build process completes successfully and generates the correct output files.

## Remaining Issues
There are still some TypeScript errors in the martial-techniques.tsx file related to missing properties ('type', 'maxLevel', 'effect') in some object definitions. These don't affect the game functionality but should be addressed in a future update for code quality.

## Deployment Impact
- The changes don't require any database migrations
- No environment variables need to be added or modified
- The build and deployment process remains the same
